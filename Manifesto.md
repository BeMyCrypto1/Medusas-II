ARCHITECTURE: The 666 Chapter Framework
The Grand Design: 
A Complete Narrative Inversion System

This document outlines the structural, philosophical, and technical architecture for Medusa Reclaimed: 
The 666 Chapter Verdict. This is not a conventional book structure, but a multi-dimensional narrative 
justice system built on GitHub.

The Threefold Inversion Principle

Narrative Sovereignty: Every chapter reclaims agency from the original myth-makers
