# Interruption Points in the Abuse-to-Femicide Pipeline

This document identifies critical moments where intervention can disrupt escalation 
before it reaches lethality. 

These following points below are well observable known and actionable long before the final stage.

---

## 1. Early Control Detection Stage

Interruption is most effective when control behaviors first appear.

Key interruption indicators:
- Monitoring disguised as concern
- Isolation framed as protection
- Financial dependency initiation
- Decision-making removal

Why this stage matters:
- Victim still retains external connections
- Psychological captivity not yet complete
- Abuser testing boundaries

---

## 2. Psychological Abuse Recognition Stage

This stage often goes unnoticed due to lack of physical violence.

Key interruption indicators:
- Gaslighting patterns
- Fear-based compliance
- Victim self-blame
- Reality distortion

Why this stage matters:
- Coercive control becomes entrenched here
- Early exit prevents trauma bonding
- Escalation is still reversible

---

## 3. First Physical Boundary Violation

This is a **critical red line**.

Includes:
- First slap, shove, or restraint
- Sexual coercion
- Property destruction
- Blocking exits

Why this stage matters:
- Violence normalization begins
- Escalation probability increases sharply
- Patterns become repetitive

---

## 4. Strangulation or Explicit Threat Stage

This is the **highest pre-lethal indicator**.

Includes:
- Choking or breath restriction
- Threats to kill
- Weapon display
- Stalking behaviors

Why this stage matters:
- Femicide risk multiplies
- Abuser rehearsing lethal control
- Immediate danger present

---

## 5. Separation Attempt Stage

Statistically the most dangerous phase.

Includes:
- Leaving the home
- Seeking help
- Filing complaints
- Refusing compliance

Why this stage matters:
- Abuser perceives total loss of control
- Violence often spikes
- Lethality window opens

## 6. Family or Community Collusion Stage

Escalation accelerates when abuse becomes collective.

Includes:
- Family meetings
- Silence enforcement

Why this stage matters:
