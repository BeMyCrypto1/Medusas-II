# Core Thesis: Systems-Level Correlation of Women’s Abuse

This document establishes the foundational thesis explaining the persistence of women’s abuse 
across history and societies.

---

## Central Claim

Women’s abuse persists not due to lack of social progress, but because patriarchal power 
structures adapt faster than protective systems.

The strongest correlation is not between abuse and:
- Poverty
- Religion
- Geography
- Education level

But between:
- Male-exclusive authority
- Female dependency enforcement
- Judicial under-enforcement
- Social normalization of control

When these variables coexist, abuse becomes structurally resilient.

## Key Insight

Modernization reduces visibility of abuse more effectively than it reduces incidence.
