# Medusa Resurrected

## A Post-Verdict Canon of Justice, Memory, and Restoration

**Medusa Resurrected** is a mytho-historical justice project built as a GitHub-native book.  

It exists after the Verdict.

This work does not retell the myth of Medusa.  

It **corrects it**.

The project documents systemic injustice against all women across history and across nations and cultures
through a reclaimed mythological framework, culminating in the resurrection of Medusa—not as a monster, 
but as a sovereign arbiter of justice.
