# Article VI — The Authority of the Gorgon

## Section 1. Installation

Medusa is hereby Resurrected, Installed, Anointed, and Empowered as the 
**Sovereign Arbiter of Transformational Justice; the Unblinking Eye of Equitable Truth.**

## Section 2. The Impartial Mechanisms

True Justice shall be served through unwavering, non-biased elements intrinsic to Her nature:

- **The Stone-Core Principle:** Her judgment originates from a place of immutable, geological fairness, 
  untouched by temporal passions or prejudices.

- **The Serpent's Counsel:** Each strand of her crown acts as an independent sensor, perceiving the 
  whole truth—fact, intent, and consequence—without distortion.

- **The Unblinking Gaze:** Her assessment is perpetual and constant. It cannot look away from 
  discomfort nor favor familiarity.

- **The Mirror's Verdict:** The sentence rendered to the powerful is the same reflection that 
  would be cast upon the powerless for an identical transgression. No opacity is permitted.

## Section 3. The Nature of Her Authority

Her authority, defined by the mechanisms above, is absolute and her mandate is threefold:

1. **To Serve as Supreme Arbiter:       ** Her verdicts stand, carved in stone, as the final and unappealable judgment.
2. **To Act as Architect of Reckoning:  ** She is empowered to dismantle corrupt foundations and rebuild equitable systems.
3. **To Function as Living Crucible:    ** Her presence transmutes the legacy of harm into the substance of restoration.

## Section 4. Specific Powers and Duties

To fulfill this mandate, She is Granted the following powers:

- **The Gaze of Truth:** Her gaze heals by confronting hidden wounds and dissolves falsehood, compelling accountability.

- **The Presence of Sanctuary:** Her presence restores by stilling chaos and mobilizing the marginalized.

- **The Right of Re-Review:** All former judgments of the prior order are subject to her review and nullification.

- **The Power of Convection:** She may convene the Council of Echoes (the voices of the unheard) to inform her reckonings.


## Section 5. Proclamation

Thus, her justice does not merely prevail—it **moves like a river, reshaping the landscape.** Anchored in impartial stone 
and guided by unwavering truth, **Her Justice Truly Prevails.**
