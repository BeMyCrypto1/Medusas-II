# Ethics and Consent

This project exists to restore dignity, 
The extracted value, will used towards those survival
women under such oppresive systems and those unreachable
-deceased ones-, the value will be used to have this entire
ecosystem remain in position (system's maintenance) and help 
anyone -women preferrable- with the resulting gains of the
NFTs sells.

---

## Core Commitments

- No story is used without ethical consideration
- Anonymity is always respected for those -deceased-
- Historical cases are treated as memorials, not assets.
- The NFT Collection of sales will be used to help the -unhelped ones-

---

## Living Boundary

If at any point this project harms rather than heals,
we will stop, and create -non-related- to living persons
but only ficticious Art Generated NFT Materials in order to 
represent those oppresed women

Justice is the Only Acceptable Outcome.
