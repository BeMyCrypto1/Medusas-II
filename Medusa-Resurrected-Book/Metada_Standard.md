## Prior to create any NFT MedusaII Collection, BMC1 needs approval of the display of the story, 
This is used as ethical approval approach details prior to NFT creation tokenization, 
if none -real person- is available for the approval. 

The NFT Medusa Creation will happens -be displayed- in for the lack of approval 
-deceased person-, but her story NFT would prevail in the BMC1 NFT MedusasII Collection 
as **"anonymous tokenization creation".**

Justice Precedes Tokenization Creation.
