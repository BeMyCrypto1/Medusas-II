# Why Medusa Must Be Resurrected

Medusa was never evil in the first place. History has for many many
years told biased and twisted facts -very similar- to real life women
that had suffered the yoke of their curse for many generations past until
now. BMC1 Medusas Book and the NFT creations are a resurrecting veridict
to their stories.

Medusa -just as many women-
She was punished for being violated.
She was unheard at the Justice system of her times.
Shea was betrayed by courts, society and many friends and family -for fear-.
She was cursed for surviving and to preserve those in power of their -corruptions-.
She was executed by a greedy and selfish  "Bounty Hunter" to preserve a lie.

This pattern did not end in mythology.
It became **Institutional** for generations.

---

## The Pattern Being Addressed

Across civilizations and centuries, women who experience violence are:
- Disbelieved
- Punished
- Exiled
- Silenced
- Rebranded as dangerous

Medusa is not an exception.
She is the Prototype.

---

## Why Resurrection, Not Revenge

This project does not seek revenge.
Revenge maintains the logic of violence.

Resurrection restores:
- Agency
- Dignity
- Authority
- Truth

Justice is not the destruction of the abuser alone.
It is the **Restoration of the Oppressed and Violated**.

---

## Why Myth Is Used

Myth is where power hides its crimes.

Legal systems, religions, and states encode injustice into Medusa's story
just as many women had been under such positions and had been "silenced" :
most of the 

      Common "retoric" statements of the abusers are...
    - “She tempted him.”
    - “He was chosen.”
    - “It was divine will.”

# Rewriting myth is not symbolism.
It is **forensic correction.**

---

## Why Medusa, Specifically

Because:
- The evidence was always visible to all that are partakers of the **Judicial Society*
- The verdict was always wrong, whether was fact twisting, false accussers, or false evidence.
- The punishment outlived the crime of those involved in the oppression or twisted veridict

# Medusa’s resurrection is not fantasy.
## It is an Overdue Correction and Recognition, along with the complete RESTORATION.
